# ðŸ§© Bank Microservices Learning Project

Welcome to my bank microservices learning project!  
This repository contains three microservices: **Accounts**, **Loans**, and **Cards**, built as part of my journey to
understand and practice microservices architecture.

> **Important Notice:**  
> This project is created **exclusively for learning purposes**.  
> It is **not intended for production use**, and no sensitive information is included in this repository.  
> All services and configurations are meant to help me experiment with building and understanding microservices concepts
> in a safe environment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The main goal of this project is to explore:

- How microservices interact with each other
- Centralized configuration management (Spring Cloud Config)
- Service registry and service discovery (Eureka)
- Understanding how load balancing works (OpenFeign via Spring Cloud Load Balancer)
- Understanding how gateway works (Spring Cloud Gateway)
- Understanding how to make microservices resilience (Resilience4j)
- Understanding how to observe microservices by creating centralized logging (Grafana, Loki &
  Alloy)
- Understanding how to monitor microservice metrics and sending alerts (Grafana, Micrometer & Prometheus)
- Understanding how to implement Distributed Tracing (Grafana, OpenTelemetry & Tempo)
- Understanding how to implement Authentication and Authorization (OpenID Connect, OAuth2 & Keycloak)
- Building and structuring services in a microservices architecture

This repository is public so that others can also reference or learn from it, but please remember:  
**It's not designed for real-world deployment.**
